  semaphore average time (x=2): 205.7ms

which method took more reader time?
peterTex (petersons/Mutex)

why?
peterTex is constantly running in the cpu and getting scheduled because of the while loop. Therefore it takes CPU time slots away from what could go to the mutex to lock and unlock the counter variable. Also, from the previous lab we also know that mutexs have more OS overhead, andtherefore take more time to process. Therefore, semaphore time will be lower.
